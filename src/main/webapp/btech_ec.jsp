							</ul><br/>
							Apart from this, the Department has its own student associations named &ldquo;Electronics project Club &rdquo; (EPC) And &ldquo;Radiance Professional Society&rdquo; that conducts many Technical Events, competitions, seminars, quizzes etc. The department is associated with other professional technical associations and societies namely IETE and IEEE which give the students, additional means to improve and update their technical knowledge and personality development.  <br/><br/>

						<span>Future Career Prospects of Bachelor Degree in ECE</span><br/><br/> 
							Electronics and Communication Engineering deals with electronic devices and software interfaces. It has a wide range of applications that helps to make our life comfortable and more convenient. It helps to increase productivity in various industries such as oil, energy, and agriculture and telecommunication media including television, radio and computers. The course is also applied to many other important sectors such as steel, petroleum and chemical industries; healthcare industry; and transportation industry.<br/>
							India is amongst the fastest growing telecom markets, which has been adding over nine million new subscribers each month in the immediate past. This creates a strong opportunity space for Electronics and Communication engineers in telecom industry. There are number of telecom industries like Vodafone, Airtel, Tata and Videocon, where Electronics and Communication Graduates have bright placement opportunities .<br/>
							India is emerging as a world class VLSI/Embedded systems hub. Electronics and Communication engineers of a high caliber can find jobs with added Specialization with large number of Multinational Corporations operating in India.<br/>
							A large number of Electronics and Communication engineers can get jobs in government organizations like MTNL, BSNL, Civil Aviation, NTPC,  Posts and Telegraph Department, Railways, Bharat Electronics Limited, DRDO many others. In the Defense services like Indian Army, Indian Air force and the Indian Navy young engineers start as Second Lieutenants.<br/>
							Opportunities are multifold for Electronics and Communication engineers. They are only limited by one&rsquo;s aptitude, training, and determination. Bright students are able to secure higher packages with specialized training in specialized areas like Mobile computing and VLSI Design.<br/>
							There are many private companies in India which offer excellent career opportunities for graduates from B.Tech in Electronics and Communications. Communication, media and entertainment industry is the biggest employer for electronics and communication engineers. In India, the media industry and communication sector has grown rapidly after privatization and there are many private firms including some multinational giants like Vodafone, Star network etc who provide good career opportunities for Electronics and Communication engineering graduates. Main sectors where B.Tech Electronics and Communication graduates can find jobs are:<br/>

   					 <ul>
   					 	<li>Telecommunication</li>
    					<li>Software Engineering/IT</li>
    					<li>Power sector</li>
   				 		<li>Hardware Manufacturing</li>
    					<li>Home Appliance and VLSI design, etc</li>
    					<li>Television Industry</li>
    					<li>Research & Development</li>
    				</ul><br/>
    				The job profile of these engineers will generally involve setting up networks and equipments, process and maintenance of electronics gears and systems etc. Hardware firms like IBM as well as communication network firms like Nokia Siemens also take in Electronics and Communication engineering graduates. Top notch IT firms also prefer Electronics and Communication engineering graduates for software engineering jobs.<br/><br/>
